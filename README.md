# 🎲 Tenzies Game (React)

A simple dice game built with React where the goal is to roll until all dice show the same value.

Users can "hold" dice to freeze their values between rolls and strategically match all dice to win.

This project was built as a React capstone to reinforce advanced state management and rendering logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Roll 10 dice with random values (1–6)
- Click individual dice to hold/unhold
- Prevent held dice from re-rolling
- Win condition detection
- Conditional rendering for win state
- Confetti animation on win (if implemented)

---

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- useState with complex array state
- Mapping over arrays for dynamic rendering
- Immutable state updates
- Functional state updates
- Derived state (win condition logic)
- Conditional rendering
- React re-render cycle understanding
- Controlled UI interactions

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (Vite / CRA)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- nanoid (for unique keys, if used)
- CSS
